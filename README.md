*DOMAIN*: POWER BI

*DURATION*: 8 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

*DESCRIPTION*: This project showcases a real-time IoT dashboard that monitors multiple environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, motion detection, light level, air quality index (AQI), CO₂ levels, and noise level. Using Python, simulated sensor data is generated and sent every 10 seconds to a Power BI Streaming Dataset via REST API. The Power BI dashboard visualizes this data through live-updating cards, line charts, and gauges, enabling instant insights into environmental conditions. Key highlights include real-time motion detection, current humidity levels, and temperature trends over time. This project demonstrates practical integration of data engineering and business intelligence for smart monitoring systems, ideal for smart rooms, labs, or industrial spaces.
